# Version 2, Vanilla JS Single Page Application

#### Made by me, for fun and with love :)
<!-- 
### Why ?

 This just a will of understanding, understanding what i'm doing and how those things works!

### How this works ?

 How the name says, this was made with pure JavaScript, in front and back end.  -->

### How to use ?

This still be in early versions, so many of the features still don't working, but if you want to try, you'll need:
 - `Node.js`, you'll need node.js to run both front and back-end servers, but for now, there is only the front-end.

To run, in the root folder, type on terminal:
 - `node index-server.js`, this will run the js file for the front-end server. Now go to your browser and enter in `http://localhost:8000` to access the page.
 - It can be run with `nodemon`, to do so just type `npm i` to download nodemon's files.
    - Now run `npm start` to run the front-end server with nodemon.

##### That's it !!! Just a personal project, i hope you enjoy it! :)
